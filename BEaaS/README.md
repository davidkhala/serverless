# Back-end as a service (BEaaS) 
Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model 
- Developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend.
- BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on servers, such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, and push notifications (for mobile apps), as well as cloud storage and hosting.
